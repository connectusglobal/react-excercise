# Connectus Global Full Stack (React) Engineering Exercise 2021

### Hello from Connectus Global!

We're excited to share this take-home exercise with you. We look forward to discussing your solution soon and hope you find this interesting along the way. We know time can be tight for projects like this. Thank you for making time to work on it. On to the challenge!

## Overview

At Connectus Global we think [React](https://reactjs.org/) is pretty great. It played a huge role for us and is the frontend framework of choice, and obviously the one we use for one of our flagship applications. If you haven't used React before (we believe almost all candidates receiving this exercise have at least some exposure), it is conceptually very similar to Angular or Vue. If you've used either, we think you'll feel comfortable with the setup here.

## What are you building?

Anything you want, no really anything..

Start from scratch, use CRA, hell create it with no library, show us what you got..

A simple SPA that exhibits the features, power and flexibility of react, and how you use it..

We are not looking for a perfect component, just an example of what you wish to show us about your react dev skills.
